# Incident Scenario – ProdEase AI Application

Incident Title:
- ProdEase AI Application Unavailable Due to Database Connectivity Failure

Date/Time:
- August 25, 2025 – 10:15 AM (GMT+8)

Detected By:
- Monitoring Alert (AppDynamics)

Severity:
- High (P1 – Business-Critical Application Outage)

Description:
- At 10:15 AM, monitoring systems detected that the ProdEase AI application was not accessible to end-users. Error logs showed repeated HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors on login attempts. Initial investigation identified that the application backend could not establish a connection with the production database cluster.

Business Impact:
- Users unable to log in or access AI-driven insights.
- Automation workflows halted.
- Impacted all APAC business users (approx. 500 users).

## Restoration Steps
Immediate Containment
1. Acknowledge incident in the incident management system (ServiceNow).
2. Notify stakeholders (Application Owner, Business Teams, IT Operations).
3. Redirect monitoring alerts to the incident bridge for live tracking.

Investigation
1. Check application logs (==/var/log/prodease-ai/==) for database-related errors.
    - Found error: ==FATAL: connection to database timed out==.
2. Validate database cluster health using monitoring tool (AWS RDS Console).
    - Primary database node was in "unavailable" state due to high CPU utilization.
3. Confirm network connectivity between application servers and database cluster.
    - No network issues detected.

Restoration Actions
1. Failover to standby replica in the RDS cluster to restore availability.
    - Executed AWS RDS failover command.
2. Restarted application backend services (==systemctl restart prodease-ai.service==).
3. Cleared connection pool and revalidated database connectivity.
4. Performed smoke testing on the application login and workflows.
    - Verified successful login and data retrieval.

Resolution
  - Application fully restored at 11:05 AM (50 minutes downtime).
  - Incident bridge closed after validation from business users.

## Post-Incident Follow-Up
- **Root Cause:** Database primary node resource exhaustion due to unoptimized queries during peak load.
- **Preventive Actions:**
    1. Optimize database queries and add indexing on frequently accessed tables.
    2. Scale up RDS instance to handle peak loads.
    3. Implement database query caching in the application.
    4. Conduct performance load testing before the next release.
